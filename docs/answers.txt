I.   Inheritance is how new objects inherit properties of it's parent classes
II.  Polymorphism is how a single object can have multiple parent classes

i) The main difference between Dictator and Lieutenants and the Integration Manager workflows is that Dictator and Lieutenants is a multi-tiered Integration Manager workflow.
j) A team of 100 developers would benefit more from Dictator and Lieutenants instead of Centralized because in a Centralized workflow, there's nobody in charge of resolving conflicts.


5. The RoleGame prototype features polymorphism in the function overloading of the hit(double armor) function in all of the weapon classes. It features encapsulation by having the name and hit points of the weapon being protected.
